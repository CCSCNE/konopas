Clearly such an interdisciplinary area crosses traditional boundaries ranging from statistics traditionally taught in mathematics or engineering departments, a new method of scientific discovery for biologists and chemists, a new challenge for ethicists and political scientists, and a new realm for design and electronic arts, etc.  Within computer science departments, it currently seems to reside in the machine learning and knowledge discovery areas where the metaphor of big data as _the new oil_ to be mined is pursued.  In this talk, however, I opine that just as oil is important for the energy it generates, which powers the technologies of modern life, data is increasingly important for the information it generates, which will power the information applications of the future.  We will explore some of these emerging trends, ranging from high performance modeling to the Watson AI system, looking at what we might want to be teaching our students if they are to be leaders in this emerging area."19,Break,Break,,,2014-04-25,14:15,15,Slavin Center outside '64 Hall,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,Paper Session 1A: Algorithmic/Computational Thinking,Paper,Session 1A,,2014-04-25,14:30,75,Slavin Center Room LL 01,16,Joan DeBello (Session Chair),,,,,,,,,,,21,A Flipped CS0 Classroom: Applying Bloom's Taxonomy to Algorithmic Thinking,Paper,Session 1A,,2014-04-25,14:30,25,Slavin Center Room LL 01,17,Namita Sarawagi,,,,,,,,,,,22,Problem Solving and Algorithmic Thinking,Paper,Session 1A,,2014-04-25,14:55,25,Slavin Center Room LL 01,18,Ed Lamagna,,,,,,,,,,,23,Computational Thinking Expanding the Toolkit,Paper,Session 1A,,2014-04-25,15:20,25,Slavin Center Room LL 01,19,Susan Imberman,20,Deborah Sturm,21,Mohammed Azhar,,,,,,,24,Tutorial Session 1B: Creating a GPS/GIS Technologies Course Module Using Google Earth,Tutorial,Session 1B,,2014-04-25,14:30,75,Slavin Center Room 112,22,Rajesh Prasad,23,Carol Trayner,,,,,,,,,25,Paper Session 1C: Alternative Approaches,Paper,Session 1C,,2014-04-25,14:30,75,Slavin Center Room LL 03,24,Alice Fisher (Session Chair),,,,,,,,,,,26,The Affective Tutor,Paper,Session 1C,,2014-04-25,14:30,25,Slavin Center Room LL 03,25,Timothy Hickey,26,William Tarimo,,,,,,,,,27,A Game Programming Instructional Design Model,Paper,Session 1C,,2014-04-25,14:55,25,Slavin Center Room LL 03,27,Penn Wu,,,,,,,,,,,28,The Human Computer,Paper,Session 1C,,2014-04-25,15:20,25,Slavin Center Room LL 03,28,Christopher Stuetzle,,,,,,,,,,,29,Break,Break,,,2014-04-25,15:45,30,Slavin Center outside '64 Hall,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,Paper Session 2A: Special Topics,Paper,Session 2A,,2014-04-25,16:15,75,Slavin Center Room LL 01,29,Daniel Rogers (Session Chair),,,,,,,,,,,31,A Cryptographic Sandbox for an Introductory Security Course in Information Security,Paper,Session 2A,,2014-04-25,16:15,25,Slavin Center Room LL 01,30,Michael Jonas,,,,,,,,,,,32,An Introduction to Event-Based Programing in App Inventor,Paper,Session 2A,,2014-04-25,16:40,25,Slavin Center Room LL 01,7,Franklyn Turbak,9,Mark Sherman,31,Fred Martin,32,David Wolber,8,Shaileen Pokress,,,33,Tutorial Session 2B: NetLogo and Multi-Agent Simulation (In Introductory Computer Science),Tutorial,Session 2B,,2014-04-25,16:15,75,Slavin Center Room 112,43,Matthew Dickerson,,,,,,,,,,,34,Tutorial Session 2C: 3D Printing - Why All the Fuss?
